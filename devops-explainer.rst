This is a quick overview of technologies I don't understand. :)

Not included here: services themselves, like databases, web servers, load
balancers, etc.

container
  Operating-system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Such instances, which are sometimes called containers, software containers, virtualization engines or jails, may look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and users. [`W <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization>`__]

virtualization
  Creating a number of virtual computers on one physical computer.


Technologies
============


Containers
----------

Containers provide virtual isolated systems by virtualizing at the process, file system and permissions level: each machine has a separate set of these user-level constructs, but share the lower-level kernel.  This means less overhead per machine.  Containers are smaller and more modular than a full virtual machine.

* Docker_
* LXD_


Virtual Machines
----------------

Virtual Machines provide virtual isolated systems by virtualizing at the hardware level: each machine believes it has control of the hardware.  Each virtual machine needs a complete operating system.  This is more overhead for each machine, but also means that you can mix operating systems: a Windows host can run a Linux guest.

* Virtualbox
* VMware


Orchestration / Deployment Management
-------------------------------------

* Ansible_: an open-source automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. [`W <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)>`__]
* Chef
* Puppet
* SaltStack_
* Fabric


Container formats
-----------------

* Docker Image
* `Open Container Initiative`_


Container runtimes
------------------

* `Docker Engine`_
* rkt_


Container orchestration
-----------------------

* Kubernetes_: a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure.
* Mesos_
* Fleet_
* `Docker Swarm`_


Provisioning
------------

* `Docker Compose`_
* `Ansible Container`_


Deployment environments
-----------------------

* Rancher
* ECS / GCS


Distributed configuration stores
--------------------------------

* Consul_
* etcd_
* zookeeper_

* AMI: Amazon Machine Image, a virtual machine image specifically for Amazon
  EC2.
* Atlas
* AWS: Amazon Web Services, a large collection of operational services from
  Amazon: EC2, S3.
* Flannel_
* Jenkins
* Nomad_
* Packer_
* Terraform_
* Travis
